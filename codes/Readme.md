For the RF and CNN methods, models trained on the 20-concert dataset are also provided, and can be used to obtain predictions on any test audio.

### Description
To obtain boundary predictions for an audio file using the unsupervised or RF methods:
1. First extract all the features using the ```extract_features``` MATLAB function (more details inside [feature_extraction](./feature_extraction))
2. To use the unsupervised method, run ...
```

```
3. To use the trained RF model, run (from within the random_forest directory)
```
predict_boundaries.py path/to/features/filename.mat
```
</br>

To use the trained CNN model, run (from within the cnn directory)
```
predict_boundaries.py path/to/audio/filename.wav
```
